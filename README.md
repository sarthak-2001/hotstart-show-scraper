# Hotstar show scraper [Unmaintained]
> This project is no longer maintained, feel free to fork it and make your changes. It may not work if the structure of hotstar.com has been changed.

## Why use this?
It extracts all the TV shows available on Hotstar into a CSV file which can further be used to keep track of all the shows that are still airing and those which have already been completed. I made this because I don't like waiting for new episodes to come out and using this I can easily find out the shows which have been completed.
## Instructions

1. Install python 3.x.x
2. FOR LINUX:
   `pip3 install -U -r ./requirements.txt` in your shell
